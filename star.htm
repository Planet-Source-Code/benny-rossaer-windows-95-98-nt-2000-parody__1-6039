<!--mstheme--><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica"><!--mstheme--></font>Everybody in the world has probably seen at least one Star Trek episode.  So, what would happen if the USS Enterprise would run under MicroShit WinSux? </strong></font></small><p><small><small><font face="Verdana">After a complete
            overhaul the USS Enterprise left the refit dock, fitted with a new computer system &#150;
            Microsoft StarShip 98. Once the ship cleared Earth&#146;s gravity, Picard told Wesley
            Crusher to lay in a course for the Andolean system. When he seemed unable to do so, Picard
            asked what the problem was. </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;Sorry Sir,&#146; said Crusher. &#145;It&#146;s
            this new navigation program, InterPlanet Explorer, I&#146;m not used to it.&#146; </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;InterPlanet Explorer?&#146; asked Picard.
            &#145;What happened to Planetscape Navigator?&#146; </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;When we installed StarShip 98, InterPlanet
            Explorer was bundled with it. We were not given the choice to run Planetscape Navigator,
            Sir,&#146; explained Data. Picard raised an eyebrow but Wesley managed to enter the
            course, and Picard gave the order to move to maximum warp. Geordie replied &#145;Yes Sir,
            just a moment.&#146; &#145;Just a moment?&#146; Picard queried sharply. &#145;Sorry
            Sir,&#146; said Geordie. &#145;When we had the refit they also installed a new antimatter
            containment field and plasma injectors, and StarShip doesn&#146;t seem to recognise the
            new hardware.&#146; </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;I thought all Starfleet technology was Plug
            and Play now,&#146; mused Picard. </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;In theory Sir,&#146; said Geordie. &#145;But
            I&#146;m having to find the device drivers manually. Ah, here we go &#150; ANTIMATR.DRV
            and PLSMINJR.DRV&#133; we are at warp 8, Sir.&#146; </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;Thank goodness for that,&#146; said Picard.
            But his relief did not last for long, for as he requested an Earl Grey Tea from the
            replicator one of the replicator&#146;s circuits burnt out. The computer blurted
            &#145;General system fault&#146; and the ship was plunged into darkness. &#145;What
            happened?&#146; Picard shouted. &#145;The replicator error crashed the system,&#146; said
            Data. </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;The whole system!? An tiny error in a
            replicator can bring down life support, propulsion, communication and all?&#146; said
            Picard incredulously. </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;Yes,&#146; replied Data. &#145;You&#146;ll
            have to reboot.&#146; </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">Picard gave the command to reboot the system, and
            the system enquired whether he wanted to reboot the ship, shut down the ship and log on as
            a different captain, or simply shut down the computer. No sooner had the computer come
            back on-line when Worf spoke the chilling words &#145;I am detecting a Borg cube on our
            sensors.&#146; </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;Shields up!&#146; ordered Picard. </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;Where do I do that?&#146; asked Worf,
            bewildered by the unfamiliar console. </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;Try &#145;Control Panel&#146;, then
            &#145;Shield Options&#146;,&#146; said Data helpfully. </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;Hail them!&#146; demanded Picard. </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;Sorry Sir,&#146; said Geordie. &#145;Our
            internal communications run on a different protocol to sub space communications, and it
            seems StarShip 98 performs unpredictably when more than one Comms protocol is installed at
            once.&#146; </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;Damn!&#146; yelled Picard, frustrated.
            &#145;Arm torpedoes!&#146; </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">The computer voice informed him that using torpedoes
            could result in damage or injury if they were not correctly configured, and said that it
            was &#145;recommended&#146; that only &#145;advanced&#146; users used these features.
            Delayed, Picard did not have time to give the order to fire before the Enterprise was
            rocked by a massive impact. &#145;The Borg have opened fire,&#146; announced Worf
            superfluously. &#145;Damage report!&#146; demanded Picard. </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;The error occured in Vx[15500:$18890], Sir. It
            may be possible to recover, Sir. Press any key to return to the system and wait,
            Sir,&#146; recited Worf. </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;What?&#146; cried Picard. &#145;Never mind
            that Vx thing, what decks??&#146; </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;Unknown,&#146; replied Worf miserably. </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;Fire phasers!&#146; said Picard desparately. </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;The phasers are not installed as standard,
            Sir,&#146; Data reported. &#145;They only come as part of the StarShip Plus! pack.&#146; </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">Before Picard could respond to this latest
            inconvenience, Worf barked urgently &#145;Shield strength is extremely low &#150; the Borg
            are preparing to board!&#146; </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;This ship is full of Starfleet&#146;s very
            latest technology! We&#146;ll have to self-destruct; we can&#146;t let these new computer
            systems fall into Borg hands!&#146; exclaimed Commander Riker. </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">&#145;Why not? It would keep the Borg off our
            backs,&#146; observed Picard bitterly, but gave the command to self destruct anyway. The
            crew scrambled to the escape craft, running down corridors lined with displays reading
            &#145;Please wait while your starship shuts down&#133;&#146; </font></small></small></p>
            <p><small><small><font face="Verdana">Picard regarded the screen bearing the words
            &#145;It is now safe to self-destruct your StarShip&#146; with misery and sadness deep in
            his heart, before abandoning the Enterprise to its ignoble end.<br>
